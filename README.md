- 👋 Hi, I’m @walknhell
- 👀 I’m interested in enhancing physical modular projects (portable solar trailers, monitoring solutions) and mapping intellectual property
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html, css and javascript, to know the basics of front end. After that, I'll be able to invest my time in mapping intellectual property with data science tools and creating a website for it (free and negotiable content)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on DIKW and portable trailer projects
- 📫 Reach me in any way you think its appropriate, I'll answer from any of my social networks
